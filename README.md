### Sparse Dynamic Volume TransUNet with multi-level edge fusion for brain tumor segmentation

-----------

Highlights

•Propose a novel encoder-decoder-based 3D brain tumor segmentation network.

•Combine voxel information, inter-layer feature connection and intra-axis information.

•Dynamically extract 3D spatial features and capture fine-grained edge details.

•Introduce a local-to-global feature modeling strategy for accurate segmentation.
#### DataSets

----------

The dataset used in this paper is BraTS2020 and 2021. The datasets can be found in kaggle, using the training set part.

It is same to source codes at https://github.com/SunMengw/SDV-TUNet.
